Some of these points of information were:\r\n\r\nCode Coverage - look at the lines of code the branch touched, and compare them to a full coverage build of the test suite. If your branch touches a line of code shared with a test - run it. \r\n\r\nModules - if your test is committed to a certain module, I'm more likely to run the entire test suite for that given module.\r\n\r\nTest History - keeping close metrics of each individual test. If this test has never failed, does it have any value? Are we just asserting that 1 == 1? Maybe it's not worth running.\r\n\r\nFailure combinations - does this test always fail when another, less expensive, test fails? If so, maybe just run the less expensive test. \r\n\r\nand of course Test Runtime - does this test take ten minutes to run? Combining this with other factors might make us deem this test unnecessary to run.\r\n\r\nAll of these factors were combined to add weights to each test for a given branch, and come up with a time-boxed test plan - a best guess for a test run which could allow us to safely merge to master. \r\n\r\nThe project was a huge success, Zenefits plans to open source it at some point, and I'm still on the hook to write a formal blog post about the whole thing :)", "sort_order": 10.0}}, {"model": "resume.workachievement", "pk": 5, "fields": {"entry": 2, "description": "\"Automate the impossible\" - creating tests to break countermeasures which are intended to fight bot traffic.
